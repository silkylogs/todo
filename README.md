# Todo
This repository hosts a collection of minimalist note taking applications, implemented in various programming languages.  
Their main job is to at the very least be able to behave in the following ways, based on their input:

`todo` without arguements prints out the earliest note added  
`todo -a "<note>"` adds a note  
`todo -l` numerically lists all notes  
`todo -d <note number>` deletes a certain note, `<notenumber>` defaults to 1  
`todo -h` lists this text
